✓ Real-time updates: Eposnow → Wix → Deliveroo in seconds
✓ Automatic reconciliation every 15 minutes (no manual work)
✓ Oversell prevention with intelligent stock alerts
✓ Complete activity log (see exactly what synced and when)

HOW IT WORKS WITH EPOSNOW
1. Connect your Eposnow Back Office API key (2 minutes)
2. Connect Wix store (one-click OAuth)
3. Our Watcher agent monitors your till 24/7
4. Every sale triggers instant sync to online channels
5. Guardian agent verifies accuracy every 15 minutes
6. Alert agent keeps you informed (no spam, only important updates)

FOUR AI AGENTS DOING THE HEAVY LIFTING
• Watcher: Watches your Eposnow till for sales
• Sync: Updates all channels instantly
• Guardian: Catches and fixes any mismatches automatically
• Alert: Sends you actionable notifications

FOR RESTAURANTS & RETAIL STORES

with your Eposnow workflow. Setup 15 minutes, then relax while AI handles sync.
